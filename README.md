# parkingLot
A simple concept test of a hypothetical parking application (at least more so the basics of one).
This is a project I was working on in a limited capacity during my first year of college. It was something I was working on as a part of my work
within my College's Civic Impact cohort.
The intended function of the current code is using flask for means of webhosting pre-made data-sets of parking lots, the spaces of said parking lots, and the occupants of said spaces along with information regarding the occupants.
